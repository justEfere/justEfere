- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @justEfere
In the exciting world of tech, I'm on a journey to master programming, having already delved into HTML and CSS.
I'm now in the process of conquering JavaScript, PHP, and Dart.
My passion lies in constantly exploring new coding concepts and technologies.
Alongside this, I'm a conversationalist with diverse interests, from economics to human anatomy, always eager to discuss what intrigues me.
My aim for the next two years is to become highly skilled in programming and bring innovative projects to life.
Thank you.
